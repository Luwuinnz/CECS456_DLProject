2. Install python libraries: tensorflow, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
3. Run formatting.py first
4. Run modelA.py and save results
5. Run modelB.py and save results
6. Compare results of modelA that is a basic CNN model of 3D, and a transfer learning model ResNet50 that is trained with medical history.
